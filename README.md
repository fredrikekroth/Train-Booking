# Train-Booking
Little ticket booking system

Made some changes from the class diagram I made, removed the Seating and Payment classes, as I considered them to be surplus. Implemented a TrainYard class to handle the program logic and not stuff the Main with unnecessary code. Hopefully I managed to get all the required functions in the program. :)

Had some minor issues trying to make Objects in lists that is Null to not be typed out, but wasn't able to find my way around that.
